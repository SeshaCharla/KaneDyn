\itbf{Problem}: Determine the number of degrees of freedom of each of the following holonomic systems:

\itbf{Sol.}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two rigid bodies attached to each other by means of a ball-and-socket connedtion.

    --The position of both the bodies is constrained but not the orientations of the individaul bodies.
    $$n=9$$

    \item An earth satellite carrying a rotor that is made to ratate at a prescribed rate about an axis fixed in the satellite.

    -- All dof's of the rotor are constrained to that of satellite except the rotation about it's axis which is also constrained as it's rate is prescribed.
    $$n = 6$$

    \item An earth satellite carrying a rotor that is made to ratate at a prescribed rate about an axis fixed in the satellite.

    -- All dof's of the rotor are constrained to that of satellite except the rotation about it's axis.
    $$n = 7$$

    \item The particles $P_1, P_2$ of Problem~$1(e)$.

    -- The only degree of freedom is the rotation about $\pmb n_z$.
    $$n=1$$
\end{enumerate}
